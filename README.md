# ðŸ§­ VaultsView - The Multi-Chain Asset Viewer

**VaultsView** is a clean, open-source tool that lets you check on any walletâ€™s holdings like tokens or NFTs across multiple blockchains at once.  
  No need to visit multiple sites. No wallet passwords. No complex UI. Just copy paste address.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Current Features

- Scan Multiple Chains balance in one page ( currently 10 Chains )
- Sort tokens according to price or value or token name
- Real time token prices with precised values
- last but not least beginner friendly UI
- Shows NFTs you forgot you minted back in past and forgot.

---

## âš¡ Why over blockscans & wallets

- We don't pop-up or navigate to pages or multiple explorers or ask connect a wallet
- Unlike traditional blockscans that bury simple balance behind complex UIs
- We don't fail to List every token that evm wallets fails to fetch
- Now you don't need to rerpeatedly enter wallet passwords just to check balance
- We Worked with speed and perfection in mind

## ðŸª„ How this works

-  **Multi-Chain Support** > Base, Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll, Linea, Zora, and even Ink (experimental because... why not).  
-  **Token Balances** > Instantly fetches native + ERC-20 tokens with live prices and USD values.  
-  **NFT Viewer** > Shows NFTs you forgot you minted back in past.  
-  **No API keys needed (for users)** â€” Everything happens client-side.  
-  **Lightning Fast** â€” Worked with speed and perfection in mind.  
-  **Developer Friendly** â€” The code is cleaner than most smart contracts out there.

---

## ðŸ§± Tech we used

-  **HTML + TailwindCSS** For the smooth UI that doesnâ€™t burn your eyes.  
-  **JavaScript (Vanilla)** No frameworks, no excuses.  
-  **Alchemy RPC & NFT API** For token and nft fetching.  
-  **DexScreener + CoinGecko** For live token prices that make your bags look richer (or poor).

## ðŸ§° How to Use

1. **Clone this beauty**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohithmoulkar/VaultsView.git
   cd VaultsView

2. **Add your Alchemy key**
  Open js/app.js and find this line:
   ```bash
   const ALCHEMY_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

3. **Run it locally**  
   Just open `index.html` in your browser â€” or go fancy:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   
  Then visit http://localhost:8000
  
4. **Enter a wallet address*** and boom â€” 8+ chains in your hands

---

## ðŸª„ How It Works

1. You enter a wallet address.  
2. The app fetches token balances and NFTs via **Alchemyâ€™s API**.  
3. Token prices come from **DexScreener** and **CoinGecko**.  
4. Everything renders clearly in **TailwindCSS** â€” no backend needed.

Basically:  
`input wallet` â†’  `fetch data` â†’  `display everything `.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Features

-  WalletConnect support (so you can flex your real wallet)  
-  Portfolio value summary across chains  
-  Token filtering 
-  NFT rarity
-  More chain integrations â€” because the multi-chains never stops expanding

## ðŸŒ‰ Base Ecosystem Optimization

Soon, **VaultsView** will be fully optimized for the **Base chain** â€” with faster endpoints, Base-native token indexing, and better cross-chain data syncing.  
Because letâ€™s be honestâ€¦ everythingâ€™s better **on Base** ðŸ§¢
